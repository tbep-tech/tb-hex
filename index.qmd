The following creates a hexagonal grid covering Tampa Bay.  The grid size is 7500 feet between opposing edges of each hexagon. The output is saved as a KML file in the data folder. 

```{r}
library(sf)
library(mapview)

# janky layer I made for all bay segments 
load(url('https://github.com/tbep-tech/benthic-dash/raw/main/data/segs.RData'))

# project, units in feet
segs <- st_transform(segs, crs = 6443)

# make the grid, defined by bounding box of segs
tbhex <- st_make_grid(segs, cellsize = 7500, what = "polygons", square = F)

# subset to tb segments
tbhex <- st_as_sf(tbhex)[segs, ]

# plot
mapview(segs) + mapview(tbhex, col.regions = NA)

# save to data folder
st_write(tbhex, 'data/tbhex.KML', driver = 'KML', delete_layer = T, quiet = T)
```
